# Ivy proofs

This repository contains a proofs of SCP's safety property (isolate protocol.safety in SCP-safety.ivy) and of SCP's liveness properties.
The liveness proof consists of the auxiliary safety invariants proved in SCP-safety.ivy, and the two lemmas proved in SCP-liveness-1.ivy and SCP-liveness-2.ivy.
To check the proofs with Ivy, use the following fork, developed by Oded Padon: [Oded's fork](https://github.com/odedp/ivy).
